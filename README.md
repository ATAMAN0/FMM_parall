# About The Project
This is an example of how you may give instructions on setting up your project locally.
To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.

1. [**How to install visual studio code**](https://youtu.be/MlIzFUI1QGA)
2. **Clone the repo**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/IlyasKadi/poisson-boltzmann.git
   ```

# Part-I 
## FMM
The fast multipole method (FMM) is a numerical methodology designed to reduce the time it takes to calculate long-ranged forces in the n-body problem. It accomplishes this by employing a multipole expansion to enlarge the system Green's function, which allows one to group sources that are close together and treat them as if they were a single source .[1]

The FMM has also been used to speed up the iterative solver in the method of moments (MOM) as applied to computational electromagnetics problems.[2] The FMM is based on the multipole expansion of the vector Helmholtz equation and was first introduced in this way by Leslie Greengard and Vladimir Rokhlin Jr.[3]. The appropriate matrix elements are not required when employing the FMM to treat interactions between far-away basis functions.

## Project-IDEA
We worked on a code that concerns FMM implementation that computes electrostatic energy and the potential difference o between the nearest leaf cells, as well as the evaluation of the local expansion and All-pair calculation of the EP, and we were able to achieve a (94.8 %) improvement in speed and optimization (without losing the values computed).
